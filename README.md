# Asteroids
A simplified version of the classic Asteroids game I created for my Android class project.

The game is available on the Google Play Store:

A short video and a text version of the code overview is available at the following locations:

Feature wish list (Future work if anyone is interested):
- Play levels: Easy, Medium, Hard
- Saving high score
- Random spacehip flying accross the screen
